## Introduction

**CloudPortal** VM (Virtual Machine) snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a virtual machine's disk file and memory state. It allows users to capture the state of a virtual machine at a particular moment, which can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as backup, disaster recovery, testing, and troubleshooting.

When a VM snapshot is taken, a copy of the virtual machine's disk file and memory state is created, which is saved as a separate file. This file can be used to restore the virtual machine to its previous state if needed.
